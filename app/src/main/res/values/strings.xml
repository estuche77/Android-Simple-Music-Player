    <string name="lyrics">Feeling the song, party done, shadows walking home\n
Walking with our game on\n
You are my kind, classic mind and you look so fine, hmm\n
Loving the cold, smoke a roll\n
See your fingers shake\n
I\'m getting through your heart break\n
Some kinda freak, sing for me, don\'t know what I need, hmm\n
Don\'t doubt me babe\n
You make me wanna change\n
Break my bed, don\'t make me wanna stay, I can\'t\n
Bite me babe, you make me love the pain\n
Break my bed, don\'t make me wanna stay\n
I can\'t\n
When you say it like that oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Got me falling right back oh-oh, oh-oh (hmm)\n
When you say it like that oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Let me fuck you right back oh-oh, oh-oh (hmm)\n
I\'m getting the door, silent walk\n
Whose the first to speak?\n
Speak it like a real freak\n
Voice in my head, in my bed\n
Filled with you instead, hmm\n
Taking your time, work my mind and I play with you\n
I play pretend it\'s so true\n
Follow me down, listen 'round to the deep dark sound, hmm\n
Don't doubt me babe\n
You make me wanna change\n
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay\n
I can't\n
Bite me babe, you make me love the pain\n
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay\n
I can't\n
When you say it like that oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Got me falling right back oh-oh, oh-oh (hmm)\n
When you say it like that oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Let me fuck you right back oh-oh, oh-oh (hmm)\n
Oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Oh-oh, oh-oh\n
When you say it like that\n
Oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Don't doubt me babe\n
You make me wanna change\n
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay\n
I can't\n
Bite me babe\n
You make me love the pain\n
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay\n
I can't\n
When you say it like that oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Got me falling right back oh-oh, oh-oh (hmm)\n
When you say it like that oh-oh, oh-oh\n
Let me fuck you right back oh-oh, oh-oh (hmm)</string>
